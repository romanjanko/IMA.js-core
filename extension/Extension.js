/**
 * Extensions provide means of extending the page controllers with additional
 * managed state and logic.
 *
 * An extension has access to the current route parameters, specify the
 * resources to load when the page is loading or being updated, may intercept
 * event bus events and modify the state of the page just like an ordinary
 * controller, except that the modifications are restricted to the state fields
 * which the extension explicitly specifies using its
 * {@link Extension#getAllowedStateKeys} method.
 *
 * All extensions to be used on a page must be added to the current controller
 * before the controller is initialized. After that, the extensions will go
 * through the same lifecycle as the controller.
