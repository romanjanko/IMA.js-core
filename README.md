Any commit that you make must follow simple rules that are automatically validated upon committing.
1. type of change (`build`, `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`)
2. scope of change in brackets `( ... )`. This should be one-word description of what part of the repository you've changed.
3. colon `:`
